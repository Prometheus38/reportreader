<p>XTX202</p>
<p></p>
<p>XTX202 is an investigational tumor-activated, beta-gamma biased IL-2 designed to potently stimulate CD8+ effector T cells and natural killer, or NK, cells without concomitant stimulation of regulatory T cells, or TREGs, when activated (unmasked) in the tumor microenvironment. In March 2024, we announced updated data from our Phase 2 clinal trial evaluating XTX202 as a monotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, who have progressed on standard-of-care treatment. Together with previously reported data, we believe these additional data further validate our tumor-activated approach and support the broad potential for XTX202 as a combination therapy. In March 2024, we also announced plans to explore strategic opportunities to continue to develop XTX202 in combination with other agents and, as part of a strategic portfolio reprioritization, plans to discontinue further investment in XTX202 as a monotherapy.</p>
