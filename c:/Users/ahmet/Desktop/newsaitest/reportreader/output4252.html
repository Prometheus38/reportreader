<p>We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company discovering and developing tumor-activated immuno-oncology, or I-O, therapies with the goal of significantly improving outcomes for people living with cancer without the systemic side effects of current I-O treatments. We are leveraging our proprietary platform to build a pipeline of novel, tumor-activated I-O molecules that are designed to optimize the therapeutic index by localizing anti-tumor activity within the tumor microenvironment, including tumor-activated cytokines and antibodies (including bispecifics) and immune cell engagers (including tumor-activated cell engagers and tumor-activated effector-enhanced cell engagers). Current I-O therapies have curative potential for patients with cancer; however, their potential is significantly curtailed by systemic toxicity that results from activity of the therapeutic molecule outside the tumor microenvironment. Our molecules are engineered to localize activity within the tumor microenvironment with minimal systemic effects, resulting in the potential to achieve enhanced anti-tumor activity and increasing the population of patients who may be eligible to receive our medicines. Our most advanced tumor-activated, clinical-stage product candidates are XTX101, an Fc-enhanced, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, or mAb, XTX301, an interleukin 12, or IL-12, therapy, and XTX202, an interleukin 2, or IL-2, therapy. In 2023, we presented clinical data across these programs showing initial clinical validation for each of these molecules and our tumor-activated approach. In addition to our clinical-stage product candidates, we are continuing to leverage our differentiated research platform and expertise in developing tumor-activated I-O therapies to advance preclinical development for tumor-activated bispecific molecules and immune cell engager molecules (including tumor-activated cell engagers and tumor-activated effector-enhanced cell engagers).</p>
