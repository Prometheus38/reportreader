<p>Overview</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company discovering and developing tumor-activated immuno-oncology, or I-O, therapies with the goal of significantly improving outcomes for people living with cancer without the systemic side effects of current I-O treatments. We are leveraging our proprietary platform to build a pipeline of novel, tumor-activated I-O molecules that are designed to optimize the therapeutic index by localizing anti-tumor activity within the tumor microenvironment, including tumor-activated cytokines and antibodies (including bispecifics) and immune cell engagers (including tumor-activated cell engagers and tumor-activated effector-enhanced cell engagers). Current I-O therapies have curative potential for patients with cancer; however, their potential is significantly curtailed by systemic toxicity that results from activity of the therapeutic molecule outside the tumor microenvironment. Our molecules are engineered to localize activity within the tumor microenvironment with minimal systemic effects, resulting in the potential to achieve enhanced anti-tumor activity and increasing the population of patients who may be eligible to receive our medicines. Our most advanced tumor-activated, clinical-stage product candidates are XTX101, an Fc-enhanced, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, or mAb, XTX301, an interleukin 12, or IL-12, therapy, and XTX202, an interleukin 2, or IL-2, therapy. In 2023, we presented clinical data across these programs showing initial clinical validation for each of these molecules and our tumor-activated approach. In addition to our clinical-stage product candidates, we are continuing to leverage our differentiated research platform and expertise in developing tumor-activated I-O therapies to advance preclinical development for tumor-activated bispecific molecules and immune cell engager molecules (including tumor-activated cell engagers and tumor-activated effector-enhanced cell engagers).</p>

<p>XTX101</p>
<p></p>
<p>XTX101 is an investigational tumor-activated, Fc-enhanced, high-affinity binding anti-CTLA-4 mAb designed to block CLTA-4 and deplete regulatory T cells when activated (unmasked) in the tumor microenvironment and improve upon the therapeutic index of existing anti-CTLA-4 therapies. In the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a co-funded clinical trial collaboration with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., or Roche, to evaluate XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq&reg;) in a multi-center, open-label Phase 1&frasl;2 clinical trial. We are currently evaluating the safety and tolerability of the combination in patients with advanced solid tumors in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the clinical trial. We plan to select a recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab in the second quarter of 2024, and subject to the results of the Phase 1 combination dose escalation portion of the trial, we plan to initiate the Phase 2 portion of the trial for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, or MSS CRC, in the third quarter of 2024. In addition, we plan to report initial Phase 2 data for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab in approximately 20 patients with MSS CRC in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in approximately 20 additional patients (40 patients total) in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>XTX301</p>
<p></p>
<p>XTX301 is an investigational tumor-activated IL-12 designed to potently stimulate anti-tumor immunity and reprogram the tumor microenvironment of poorly immunogenic &quot;cold&quot; tumors towards an inflamed or &quot;hot&quot; state. In March 2024, our wholly-owned subsidiary Xilio Development, Inc., or Xilio Development, entered into an exclusive license agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, pursuant to which it granted Gilead an exclusive global license to develop and commercialize XTX301 and specified other molecules directed at IL-12. For more information, please see &quot;--License and Collaboration Agreements--Exclusive License Agreement with Gilead&quot; below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are currently evaluating XTX301 in an ongoing Phase 1 first-in-human, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XTX301 as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. In January 2024, we reported preliminary safety data into the third dose level in the Phase 1 dose escalation and anticipate reporting safety, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamic, or PD, data for XTX301 in the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>
