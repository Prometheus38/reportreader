<p>VUNO, a Korean medical AI company, said Wednesday that it had completed the U.S. trademark registration of VUNO Med-DeepCARS, an artificial intelligence-based cardiac arrest prediction device.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VUNO Med-DeepCARS is the first AI medical device in the Korean medical AI industry to be designated as an innovative medical device by the U.S. FDA. It analyzes data on four vital signs -- breathing, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature -- of inpatients in general wards to predict whether a patient will have a cardiac arrest within 24 hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The company is conducting clinical studies with U.S. medical institutions to obtain FDA clearance for the product, which is targeted for the second half of this year. It has also completed U.S. patent registration for its core technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to VUNO, as of March this year, VUNO Med-DeepCARS had been adopted by 83 hospitals, including 15 tertiary general hospitals, and the demonstration and purchase process was underway at an additional 40 hospitals. The cumulative number of billed beds has exceeded 33,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VUNO also completed the U.S. trademark registration of its chronic disease management brand, Hativ. Hativ is a healthcare brand comprising three home medical devices: the Hativ P30, an electrocardiogram device, a blood pressure monitor, a thermometer, and a healthcare mobile app. Starting with the U.S. trademark registration, VUNO plans to prepare for Hativ's entry into the U.S. market step by step, including obtaining FDA's clearance for Hativ P30 in mid-2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Our preparations for entering the US market are progressing smoothly, from the FDA's innovative medical device designation to local clinical research, technology patents, and trademark registration.&quot; VUNO CEO Yeha Lee said. &quot;We have established domestic and overseas business strategies tailored to each of our major products, including Hativ, and will continue to strive to achieve business results as planned.&quot;</p>
